### Laptop Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the price of a laptop based on selected features, utilizing a machine learning model integrated into a web application. The entire process, from data preprocessing to model deployment, is implemented using Python.

#### Project Workflow:
- **Data Preprocessing:** The project begins by acquiring a dataset of laptop features and prices. Using NumPy and Pandas, the data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for model training.
- **Model Training:** A Random Forest algorithm is employed to train the model, leveraging its ability to handle complex data relationships and provide accurate predictions based on the selected features.
- **Web Application:** The trained model is then connected to a user-friendly web application built using the Python Flask framework. This allows users to input laptop features and receive a predicted price, making the model accessible and easy to use.

This project demonstrates my ability to handle end-to-end machine learning tasks, from data preprocessing and model training to deploying the model within a web application for real-time predictions.
